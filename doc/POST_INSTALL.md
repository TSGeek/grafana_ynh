## Configuration

**Important at first login:**

* you have to go the Grafana Menu (Grafana icon), select your account menu and select *Switch to Main Org.*
* you can now access the default NetData dashboard via the Home menu

**Don't hesitate to create new dashboards**: the default dashboard contains metrics from NetData, but only generic ones that are generated on every machine. NetData dynamically detects services and applications (e.g.redis, nginx, etc.) and enriches its dashboard and generated metrics. Many NetData metrics don't appear in the provided default Grafana dashboard!
